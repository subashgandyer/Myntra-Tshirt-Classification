## Objective

The objective of this HackerEarth Computer Vision challenge is to build a State-of-the-art classification system that will classify 23 classes of Tshirt graphics, which will position me in Top-10 of the leaderboard.

## Description

Images of different kinds of Tshirt Graphics like Camouflage, Solid, Striped, Tribal and so on are given. A pre-trained network like Resnet34 is used to fine-tune the classifier with these images. Images are cleaned, pre-processed and fed to the network. Deep learning model is built with the best features for discriminating these Tshirt types. The built model is optimized for generalization and accuracy. The optimized model is then validated and evaluated against the test set. I was placed 30th in the competition out of 3500+ competitors. Top 1%
